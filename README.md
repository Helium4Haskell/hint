### Helium

Helium is a functional programming language (a subset of Haskell) and a
compiler designed especially for teaching. The main developers and
initiators are Arjan van IJzendoorn, Rijk Jan van Haaften, Bastiaan
Heeren and Daan Leijen. Currently, Jurriaan Hage, and Bastiaan Heeren
maintain the compiler and associated tools. For more information about
Helium contact [us](mailto:helium4haskell@gmail.com).

### Hint

Helium 1.8.1 and higher again have support to work with the graphical
Java-based programming environment Hint, originally developed by Arie
Middelkoop.

[**Download the Hint 1.8.1 jar
file**](http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/jur/Hint-1.8.1.jar)

The program can be run from the command line in the usual way

       java -jar Hint-1.8.1.jar

Of course, you must have the Java runtime installed on the system. Note
that you need Hint version 1.8.1 or higher for this to work.

### Beyond the standard distributions

All software associated with Helium is available from a publicly
available git repository at <https://github.com/Helium4Haskell/>, in
particular the repositories.
